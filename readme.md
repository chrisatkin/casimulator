CASimulator
===========

What is this?
-------------

CASimulator is the (hopefully going to be) basis for my third-year project. It simualtes two Wolfram rule-based cellular automatas running in parallel. CASimulator is written in Java.

Building
--------

Just run `build.sh` and then `cd bin; javac CASimulator`
